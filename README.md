# 🏧 ATM Simulator using Python

A command-line based ATM simulation program written in Python. This project mimics real-world ATM functionalities like checking account balance, withdrawing and depositing cash, changing PIN, and viewing transaction history.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ PIN authentication
- 💰 Check balance
- 💸 Withdraw cash with validation
- 💵 Deposit cash
- 🔐 Change 4-digit PIN
- 📋 View transaction history
- ❌ Exit gracefully

---

## 📸 Preview

```
=========== Welcome To ATM ==========
Please insert the card
Enter the 4 digits pin: ****

============ATM MENU============
 1. Check balance
 2. Withdraw cash
 3. Deposit cash
 4. Change pin
 5. Transaction history
 6. Exit

Enter your choice (1-6): 1
Current Balance: 5000
```

### 💼 Real-World Relevance

Though simplified, this simulator models core features of a banking ATM system. It's a great entry point into more complex applications such as secure banking software, with potential enhancements like:

- User authentication from files or databases  
- Secure PIN encryption  
- GUI integration using Tkinter  
- Backend services using Flask or Django  
- Persistent storage for balance and transaction records

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This project helps reinforce:

- Python syntax and structure
- `input()` and `print()` operations
- Conditionals and loops
- Functions and parameters
- Exception handling (`try-except`)
- Lists for storing transaction history
- Simple state management with variables

Perfect for students or beginners looking to build foundational logic through a fun and realistic project!
